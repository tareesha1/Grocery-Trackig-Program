# Grocery-Trackig-Program
The task is to build an item-tracking program, which should incorporate all of their requested functionalilty. 
Project Summary

The project involved developing a grocery-tracking program for the Corner Grocer to calculate sales numbers and optimize store design. The program reads an input file, tracks item frequency, prints information, generates a histogram, and saves records for backup.

Strengths & Improvements

I effectively ran the program by using a class and maps for efficiency. Good documentation ensured readability of code. It can be improved by stricter input validation and file handling to make it work better.

Challenges & Solutions

Getting the histogram in proper format was troublesome, but debugging in Visual Studio and adequate manipulation for strings helped solve the issues.

Transferable Skills

This project improved my skills in handling and working with files, data structures, and user interaction, which will prove useful in subsequent software development.

Maintainability & Adaptability

By using best practices like modular functions and descriptive names, I ensured ease of modifying and increasing the code for future versions.
